Easy Install
============

Easy install isn't supported just yet. Sorry.

Setuptools
==========

You can install Pyposterous with setuptools by executing the following in a terminal::

	git clone git://github.com/thomasw/pyposterous.git
	cd pyposterous
	sudo python setup.py install


Manual Installation
===================

To install Pyposterous manually, just put the pyposterous subdirectory of the `pyposterous repository <http://github.com/thomasw/pyposterous>`_ somewhere on your Python path. If you install it this way, you may also need to grab:

* `urllib2_file <http://github.com/seisen/urllib2_file>`_
* `ElementTree <http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm>`_ (included in Python >2.5)
